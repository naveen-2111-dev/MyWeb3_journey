# Insufficient Funds While Deploying – My Deployment Experience

## Issue: "Insufficient Funds for Gas" Error

While deploying my **BarterX** smart contract on the **Sepolia** testnet, I encountered the following error:

```bash
Error: insufficient funds for intrinsic transaction cost
```

This was particularly frustrating as I had followed multiple tutorials, yet none explicitly addressed this issue in detail.

---

## Cause

The deployment process requires **Sepolia ETH** to cover gas fees. Since my wallet did not have sufficient test ETH, the transaction failed.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, I explored the following approaches:

### 1️⃣ Claiming Sepolia ETH from Faucets

- **Google Sepolia Ethereum Faucet**: Several faucets provide test ETH for Sepolia.
- **zkSync Era Sepolia Faucet**: Some faucets are available through zkSync Era.
- **Bridge from zkSync Era Sepolia to Sepolia ETH**: Another option is bridging ETH from other test networks.

### 2️⃣ Acquiring Testnet ETH from the Community

- Collecting test ETH from friends or community members can also be helpful.

## Understanding Base Fees and Network Congestion

### Base Fee (EIP-1559 Standard)

According to **EIP-1559**, every transaction on the Ethereum network must pay a **minimum gas fee**, known as the **base fee**. This fee fluctuates based on **network congestion**:

- If network traffic is high, the base fee increases.
- If network traffic is low, the base fee decreases.

If a transaction does not meet the required base fee, the **"insufficient funds"** error occurs.

---

## My Experience: Facing High Base Fees

Over the past two days, **network congestion** caused the base fee to fluctuate between **95 Gwei** and **333 Gwei**. My project **required Sepolia** since OpenSea supports only Sepolia testnet for NFT interactions. I had two possible approaches:

### Case 1: Waiting for Base Fee Reduction

I researched multiple sources, including **websites, tutorials, and ChatGPT**, which suggested that gas fees are lower between **3 AM and 6 AM**. I monitored the network and found the base fee at **3 AM was 162.35 Gwei**, which was still too high. Since faucets provide only **0.03 Sepolia ETH per day**, I had to wait longer.

Unexpectedly, at **11 AM**, the base fee dropped to **0.01 Gwei**.

#### Deployment Attempt:

- I attempted to deploy my contract but encountered an error again.
- Frustrated, I cleared my **cache** and **MetaMask activity**.
- I retried the deployment, and this time it was successful.

### Case 2: Optimizing the Contract and Retrying Later

If gas fees remain high, it is best to **wait for a reduction** and optimize the contract in the meantime by removing redundant elements and efficiently structuring data storage based on EVM protocols.

#### Best Practices for Optimizing Solidity Contracts

**1️⃣ Group Smaller Data Types Together**  
Arrange struct members so that smaller types (e.g., `uint8`, `uint16`, `bool`, `address`) fit within the same 32-byte storage slot.

**2️⃣ Avoid Misaligned Storage**  
If a large variable (e.g., `uint256`) appears before smaller variables, it can cause inefficient storage use.

**3️⃣ Use Fixed-Size Data Types**  
Use `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, etc., instead of `uint256` where possible to reduce storage slot wastage.

**Example of an Optimized Struct:**

```solidity
struct NonOptimized {
    uint256 a;   // Takes up a full 32-byte slot
    bool b;      // Takes up a new 32-byte slot (only needs 1 byte)
    uint128 c;   // Takes up another 32-byte slot
}
```

```solidity
struct Optimized {
    uint128 c;  // 16 bytes
    bool b;     // 1 byte
    uint256 a;  // 32 bytes, starts in a new storage slot
}
```

#### Additional Optimization Suggestions

- Use `uint8` instead of `bool` where applicable.
- Use `bytes32` instead of `string` if possible.
- Avoid unnecessary loops.
- Use `require` instead of `assert` to save gas.
- Minimize unnecessary contract calls until they are absolutely needed.

### Setting Gas Limits in Frontend Calls

When making function calls to the contract from the frontend using **ethers.js** or **web3.js**, always **set a gas limit**. A standard value of **300,000** gas suits most contracts but should be adjusted based on your needs.

## Conclusion

Deploying a smart contract requires careful planning, especially in terms of gas fees. Key takeaways:

- Ensure **sufficient Sepolia ETH** in your wallet.
- Monitor **network congestion** and deploy when fees are lower.
- Consider **clearing cache and MetaMask activity** if issues persist.
- Be patient and strategic in choosing the right deployment time.
- Optimize smart contracts for **gas efficiency**.

By following these steps, I successfully deployed my **BarterX** smart contract on Sepolia.
